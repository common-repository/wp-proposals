== NEW PLUGIN! ==

<a href="https://wpproposals.com/" target="_blank">WP Proposals</a> is a brand new plugin by <a href="https://wpcodeus.com/" target="_blank">WP Codeus</a>. We’re excited to keep bringing you new features and a soon to be release pro-version which will include even more awesome features! Give it a try and let us know your thoughts!


== Professional Online Proposals ==

WP Proposals revolutionizes your ability to create stunning online proposals directly from your WordPress dashboard. Giving you the competitive edge allowing your sales team to streamline the proposal and invoicing process all within your current WordPress install.


== CUSTOMIZE TO MATCH YOUR BRAND AND STYLE ==

We know how important your companies brand and image is to you. That’s why when we built WP Proposals we made sure to give you the ability to completely brand and style your proposals to your needs.

Gone are the days of spending hours and hours in Photoshop or Indesign. WP Proposals allows any team member to add your own branding and content in minutes. Unlike other proposal software on the market, you no longer need to pay extra to add your own logo or domain.


== MONITOR PROPOSAL VIEWS AND FOLLOW UP ==

Waiting to hear back after you send a proposal can be agony. WP Proposals allows you to keep track of how many times your client views your proposals, and most importantly notifies you when they have accepted it!

View counts are also a great way to determine when and if you should send a follow up email. Follow up emails are a great way to show your clients that you care and most important to not allow them to forget about you.


== SEND AND RECIEVE PROPOSAL NOTIFICATIONS ==

WP Proposals allows you to send branded and templated emails to your client to view their proposal online. This is just another tool to give you and your business a competitive edge over your competition.

WP Proposals will also notify you when a proposal has been approved by whom, when, and for how much. Want your whole sales team to be notified? Not a problem there is an option for that too.


== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the wp-proposals folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
1. Configure settings by going to WP Proposals and Settings
